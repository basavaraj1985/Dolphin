Features: <br>
1. On iOSSimulator/Android emulator/real devices automation run support - no code change required. Need to work on provisioning profiles for ios. <br>
2. Multi threaded - parallel execution - so its faster. <br>
3. Automation framework is Data driven, randomness enabled, easily configurable. <br>
4. Multiple Locator strategies supported - xpath, css, class, id... <br>
	TestCode is insulated from the headache. Faster to find locators, if xpath is tricky, use css, vice versa. <br>
5. Configuration is easy and priority based. testng.xml configuration overrides flat 
	file config, if present. <br>
6. Environment aware RetryAnalyser - helpful to avoid false failures when qa.syc is down. <br>
7. JS Errors are caught and reported - when ff driver used. <br>
8. Can run automation on multiple environments at a time parallely. <br>
9. Screenshots - more useful, are of mobile dimensions, analysed for UI errors.  <br>
10. Smart reporting enabled - lot lesser time in failure analysis. Delta and failure based reports are provided. <br>
11. Smart reporting with history trend is provided. You can see red delta trend over number of runs. <br>
12. HTML Logging - flag controlled. The test log itself has screenshots, with steps, debug info, test description.<br>
13. UI Spec validation is implicitly supported. Just provide expected ui specs along with locators and invoke ui spec validation. <br>
